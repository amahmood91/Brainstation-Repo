    "There are a ton of packages for interacting with databases. One of the more common is SQL-alchemy. SQL-alchemy is a way of wrapping a database object in a map, so we can work with data models, and reduce our queries to the bare minumum. For our purposes, it's a bit much, so we will go to one level lower, pyodbc.\n",

    "More or less this means that the details and code of connecting to a postgresql database running on windows, or a mongoDB instance on Solaris can be forgotten about, and we can interact with them through the odbc connector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try and get some database data into python. There is a bit of hacking required to get pyodbc to connect to MAMP, so for now we will use a sqlite database file and sqlite3. \n",
