    "Python is an object orientated language. We have objects, which are instances of types, these interact with each other, and can contain data or attributes. We can compare this to something like R or Scala which are more functional, we have objects or data, and we modify them by functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gets a bit theoretical so we can use Pac-Man as an example. In Pac-Man, we can say we have the class of ghosts, and each ghost: Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde are instances of the type. They share general attributes such as wanting to chase pacman and having similar appearances and general behaviour. However, they are different when it comes to other attributes such as colour, speed and behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
