    "There are a ton of packages for interacting with databases. One of the more common is SQL-alchemy. SQL-alchemy is a way of wrapping a database object in a map, so we can work with data models, and reduce our queries to the bare minumum. For our purposes, it's a bit much, so we will go to one level lower, pyodbc.\n",

    "More or less this means that the details and code of connecting to a postgresql database running on windows, or a mongoDB instance on Solaris can be forgotten about, and we can interact with them through the odbc connector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try and get some database data into python. There is a bit of hacking required to get pyodbc to connect to MAMP, so for now we will use a sqlite database file and sqlite3. \n",

Scipy.sparse also has a large amount of linear algebra functions implemented in ways that take advantage of sparse data, and can run much faster than their dense alternatives, as well as the memory savings of sparsity.

The exact choice depends on your application, try them out and see if you need to dive into the library."
