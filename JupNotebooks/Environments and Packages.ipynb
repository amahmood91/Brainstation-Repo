It is heavily curated and is a little slow to update. PyPI contains everything, is not curated and is very easy to publish to (we could write our own package if we wanted). [PyPi has had some recent security concerns](https://www.bytelion.com/pypi-python-package-hack/), so use your judgment when installing. Conda also tries to distribute binaries- some more complicated packages require compilation from source from PyPI.\n",
